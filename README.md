You can use the following **unique, original addition** to differentiate the Train Booking System:

This system's **AI-driven travel optimizer** is a special feature that makes recommendations for the best travel times, less expensive detours, and crowd-level forecasts based on past trends. It features smart seat recommendations based on comfort preferences, **voice-based ticket booking** , and a **virtual coach walkthrough** that allows passengers to see their seats before making a reservation. Additionally, it provides **eco-score indicators** that illustrate how each trip affects carbon consumption and suggest more environmentally friendly travel choices.
